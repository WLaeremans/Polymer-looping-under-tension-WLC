# Polymer-looping-under-tension-WLC
Code used for preprint: "Polymer dynamics under tension: mean first passage time for looping", by Wout Laeremans and Wouter G. Ellenbroek.

## LAMMPS
The main LAMMPS file is main.lmp, which contains the code for a wormlike chain of semiflexible chain polymer under tension and outputs the timestep at which is formed a loop (two most outer beads as close as some capture distance r_c). In the example uploaded, the polymer contains 50 beads, and the corresponding data file is given in polymer50.data.
