# Polymer-looping-under-tension-WLC
Code used for preprint: "Polymer dynamics under tension: mean first passage time for looping", by Wout Laeremans and Wouter G. Ellenbroek.

## LAMMPS
The main LAMMPS file is main.lmp, which contains the code for a wormlike chain of semiflexible chain polymer under tension and outputs the timestep at which is formed a loop (two most outer beads as close as some capture distance r_c). In the example uploaded, the polymer contains 50 beads (so N = 49), and the corresponding data file is given in polymer50.data. This file can be easily adapted to simulate a different number of beads, similar to the other parameters in this example. The files rxn_pre.data_template, rxn_post.data_template and rxn.map are only included to check when a loop is formed. For this, we used the REACTER package and define a reaction when the two outer points of the polymer are as close as the capture distance. This reaction is implemented in lines 50-52. In this example, the capture distance is set to r_c = 1.0, and to change it one should change the 1.0 on line 51 to the desired distance. However, note that a bigger capture distance might require to make a small change in the main and data file, as was noted in: https://github.com/WLaeremans/Polymer-looping-under-tension-FJC-.git.[ ](https://github.com/WLaeremans/Polymer-looping-under-tension-FJC-.git)
